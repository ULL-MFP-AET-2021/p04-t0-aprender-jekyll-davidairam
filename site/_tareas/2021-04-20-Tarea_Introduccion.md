You can insert some formula $$f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \hat f(\xi)\,e^{2 \pi i \xi x} \,d\xi$$ in the middle of a sentence.

You can also put large formulas in their own paragraph:

<br><br>
$$f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \hat f(\xi)\,e^{2 \pi i \xi x} \,d\xi$$
<br>
$$mean = \frac{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}}{n}$$
